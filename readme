# ESP32 WiFi and MQTT 

This example demonstrates how to connect an ESP32 microcontroller to a WiFi network and an MQTT broker. It uses the Arduino IDE and the PubSubClient library.

## Description

The code establishes a WiFi connection, connects to an MQTT broker, subscribes to a specific topic, and prints incoming messages to the serial monitor.

## Prerequisites

- Arduino IDE installed
- ESP32 board support installed in the Arduino IDE
- PubSubClient library installed

## Instructions

1. Open the Arduino IDE.
2. Install the ESP32 board support if not already installed:
   - Go to **File** > **Preferences**.
   - In the "Additional Boards Manager URLs" field, enter `https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json`.
   - Click **OK** to save the preferences.
   - Go to **Tools** > **Board** > **Boards Manager**.
   - Search for "esp32" and install the ESP32 platform.
3. Install the PubSubClient library:
   - Go to **Sketch** > **Include Library** > **Manage Libraries**.
   - Search for "PubSubClient" and install the library by Nick O'Leary.
4. Connect your ESP32 board to your computer via USB.
5. Open the provided code snippet in the Arduino IDE.
6. Modify the Wi-Fi and MQTT settings in the code (`ssid`, `password`, `mqttServer`, `mqttPort`, `mqttUser`, `mqttPassword`) to match your network and MQTT broker details.
7. Upload the code to your ESP32 board by clicking the **Upload** button.
8. Open the serial monitor in the Arduino IDE by clicking the **Serial Monitor** button.
9. Verify that the ESP32 successfully connects to the Wi-Fi network and the MQTT broker.
10. Any incoming MQTT messages on the subscribed topic will be printed in the serial monitor.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues with the code, make sure you have correctly installed the ESP32 board support and the PubSubClient library.
- Double-check your Wi-Fi and MQTT credentials to ensure they are accurate.
- Ensure that your MQTT broker is accessible and the specified topic is valid.
